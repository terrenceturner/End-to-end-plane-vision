# End-to-end-plane-vision

The military has multiple uses for satellites. The most common missions are intelligence gathering, navigation, and military communications. When it comes to target recognition, enhancing the accuracy during combat environments would be ideal. These techniques will allow defense forces to understand potential operation areas by analyzing reports, documents, news feeds, and other forms of unstructured information. Additionally, AI in target recognition systems improves these systems' ability to identify the position of their targets. Being able to track and identify potential threats would be beneficial to the military. The goal of this project is to detect an aircraft given a satellite image.
 
The image dataset will be from Kaggle. The data contains two classes, plane or no-plane. The plane class consists of 8,000 satellite images with planes. The No-plane class consists of 24,000 satellite images. A third of these are a random sampling of different landcover features - water, vegetation, bare earth, buildings, etc. - that do not include any portion of an airplane. The next third is "partial planes" containing a portion of an airplane, but not enough to meet the full definition of the "plane" class. The last third is "confusers" - chips with bright objects or strong linear features that resemble a plane.
